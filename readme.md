# Atlas Shiny Apps

This repo will contain shiny apps that match the following analyses in Atlas

* Cohort Counts
* Incidence Rates
* Characterization

These apps consume WebAPI output. The WebAPI output for a particular Atlas
analysis should be placed as text files in the the /data/ folder of each app.
The app can then be deployed on a shiny server.

Cohort Counts app demo: https://ablack3.shinyapps.io/cohortCounts/

Incidence Rate app demo: https://ablack3.shinyapps.io/IncidenceRate/

Cohort Caracterization app demo (in draft): https://laac.shinyapps.io/cohortCharacterization/
